# Welcome to egonzalez blog

My name is Eduardo Gonzalez, also know as egonzalez in OpenStack and NFV communities and xNaaro in hacking groups.

I'm a passionate Open Source advocate who has been independently contributing to OpenStack for over 4 years, served as Project Team Lead (PTL) in OpenStack Kolla project and still being a core reviewer. Also I've contributed to many other Open Source projects related to NFV, Python, Ansible, security tools, etc.

My main specializations are:

* Containerize OpenStack services
* Python Software Development
* SDN, NFV and Edge integration and deployment
* Infrastructure as Code (primarily Ansible)
* Docker and k8s
* Design and implement complex upgrade procedures

Recently I've been pushing hard to increase my skills about hacking, pentesting and bug bounty.

Miscellaneous:

* I like do code reviews
* I like do mentoring
* I like innovate and learn new things, routine is boring
* Try harder as rule
